Eventually my mother agreed that they would send me to boarding school in a different city and when I wasn't at school I will stay with my grandparents. I never knew why he didn't want to have me around. He had a son and a daughter around my age and more than enough space since he had a very large house. It was a very good school, but I hated it. I was removed from all my friends and from my family, especially my little sister and was shipped to a new city with new people and no friends or family. Everytime I came back I had to stay with my grandparents who were nice, but really old and it was lonely as well. I couldn't even visit my sister, she and her mother had to come to me.

I was never involved in celebrations, holidays, etc. When I went to college I started having less and less contact. It was just natural. I felt unwelcome so I stayed away.

Over the past month I've developed a big crush on her which is when we started hanging out just the two of us more than we ever had. We have a lot in common but she's a flirty person (touching, calling people romantic names when there's no romance) so it's hard to tell sometimes if she's even interested in me in a romantic way. The other day me, her, and our friend (her best friend) went out together. We were driving and her best friend (who had a few to drink) brings up a few separate times about how me and my crush should date. They both were talking about how I was \"boyfriend goals\" and \"husband goals\" but it's just confusing trying to tell if my crush is actually interested in me. She is leaving in two weeks to start law school, which is about an hour away from where we live. So I have a few things to consider before acting on my feelings. If I get shut down, things could be awkward between us and our friends. She may not want to do a LDR even if it's only an hour away. With law school she may not even have time for a new relationship, at least until she gets into the swing of things. If she wasn't a friend, I would have asked her out by now. But I feel like there's a lot to lose if things don't go the way I want. I don't even want to tell any of my friends in that group about my feelings in case it gets around (girls love to gossip in our group).

It is seemingly a comfortable and minimally difficult relationship. We both live on campus at school and spend pretty much all free time spent at school together, not really doing anything. For example, if we both get out of class at 12, we will immediately get together and spend the rest of the day together unless I have practice or a match as I am an athlete at the school. We will go back to my room and watch tv and such for the remainder of the day. Every day of the week, excluding weekends as we each typically return home. Before college, I was always keeping busy with something. I very much enjoyed playing video games with my friends or just having time to myself to do whatever. She has accused me before of being immature due to my desire to spend time with my friends, Daniel and Colin, who are seniors in high school.

Text: So my problem is that I know that I am being a hypocrite, and have double standards with my girlfriend. The problem is that I really dislike the idea of her smoking weed. I have always associated it with specific bad people I know who I do not want to put in the same group as my girlfriend. The thing is, she has only done it about three times ever. Once a long time ago, once about 9 months ago (which I just found out about today from her) and once tonight. In my head, I think of it as a sketchy thing to do, and I have never seen her when she does it so I think that might contribute to the feeling. I always envision her making bad decisions while high, even though she has never done anything to make me think that way. The other part of the story is that I have friends who do it on a regular basis. Although I never partake in doing it, I don't have a problem with them doing it, even though it is so much more often than my girlfriend. I really, really don't want to look down on it with my girlfriend because I know it is the furthest thing from a regular habit for her. I really get angry at myself because I can never truly get myself to not mind that she has tried it a few times, even though my brain keeps telling myself to \"let it go\" and that it's \"not a big deal.\" I just can't seem to convince myself, and I was hoping to get some help.

Title: I [29m] really screwed up a few months ago with some random [?\/f] Text: My long term SO broke up with me a while back and I went into an alcoholic coma for a few months. I dated a few women during that time, one of which I had unprotected sex with three or four times. She (I think she was 25 or 26, I can't even remember.) told me she had her tubes tied and because of my mental state I never questioned it. Until now. There are a few things that lead me to believe she may have been lying to me and got exactly what she wanted, but going into such detail would make this a much longer post than it needs to be. She also had a very, very fucked up past and while she seemed stable when we met, makes me think something like this might be rational to her, especially in terms of money. Specifically mine. I realize I'm an idiot, I'm fully aware. The worst part is this is totally out of character for me, I don't do things like this, I know better than this, but because of my own circumstances at the time I made a huge mistake and now I need to know what I should do. I don't want to wake up one day in a few months to a phone call or letter in the mail, completely unprepared to a paternity test. I don't know how I can confirm or deny a potential pregnancy when I don't even remember this womans phone number or address, but I'd sleep much better if I could just know before that (potentially) dreadful day. Money isn't really an issue. If I need to I can go get a good lawyer tomorrow and do whatever it takes, I just need to know what to do. Like I said, this isn't something I have experience with, I was in a horrible state, so I have no idea what I'm supposed to do. It's keeping me up at night.

My SO and myself adopted Mikey from the shelter in April this year. He's a Yorkshire Terrier Mix (maybe with a Dachshund) and he was found abandoned in a bank parking lot. He is 4 years old, ~15 lbs now (12 when we rescued him), extremely cute\/cuddly, and friendly to everyone. Mikey has a lot of problems, but I'd like to highlight two very important ones and ask for your advice. **(1) Mikey throws up, a lot.** At first it started on the way home from the shelter. He threw up in the car and we thought he just got motion sickness. Then we realized he has extremely sensitive motion sickness... on a train, a short car ride, and even just playing with a ball by himself... he throws up, constantly. I've tried not letting him eat before we go on rides and giving him motion sickness food a couple hours prior to travel.. but neither solution has worked. **(2) Mikey is\/isn't house trained.** Our family life is as follows: SO takes him for a 30m walk in the morning, he's home for maybe 6-8 hours by himself, and then I get home and take him for a 30m walk and look after him. Throughout the day, he has been peeing\/pooping on his pad and we clean it up and replace it with a new one. However, he sometimes has... accidents. We live in an apartment complex and he has pooped\/peed in a couple occasions in the hallway while I'm taking the trash out. I immediately tell him 'no', and I always call him a good boy every time he does pee on his pad. Sometimes even he'll poop next to the patio door, our bedroom door, or the hallway door. When he's outside, he literally attempts to pee on everything. He has even peed on my boss' bag and a coworker's leg at a company BBQ, which was incredibly humiliating to me.

However, I had been reading more and more about how the market sucks for lawyers. And I started doubting my decision to attend law school.
